This is the single highest-leverage item for closing the Monitor-Diagnose gap.\n\n## Flywheel Stage\nMonitor + Diagnose (connects Release to Diagnose)\n\n## Problem\nThe structured error system (40+ ErrorCodes in src/types/errors.ts) produces rich, machine-readable error context — but it evaporates after the user's session ends. The maintainer has zero visibility into what errors are happening across the user base, at what frequency, or correlated with which release.\n\n## What to Design\n\n### Payload shape\nMinimal, anonymized. Candidate fields:\n- error_code (e.g., DEVICE_OFFLINE, BUILD_FAILED)\n- tool_name (e.g., adb-device, gradle-build)\n- replicant_mcp_version (e.g., 1.4.8)\n- os_platform (e.g., darwin, linux, win32)\n- android_version (if detectable from connected device)\n- timestamp (ISO 8601)\n- NO PII, no file paths, no stderr content, no device serial\n\n### Opt-in mechanism\nMCP servers run inside Claude Desktop/Code. Design decisions needed:\n- How does a user opt in? Environment variable? First-run prompt? Config file?\n- What's the default? (Must be opt-in, not opt-out, for trust.)\n- How does the user opt back out?\n- Should the MCP client (Claude) be involved in consent, or is it server-side only?\n\n### Transport\nWhere do payloads go? Evaluate tradeoffs:\n- **GitHub Actions dispatch**: Free, in-ecosystem, but rate-limited and not real-time\n- **Cloudflare Worker + D1/R2**: Cheap, fast, requires infrastructure\n- **JSONL file in repo on a branch**: Zero-cost but noisy git history\n- **Sentry/PostHog free tier**: Mature tooling but external dependency\n- Consider: What's the simplest thing that gives us error-code frequency by version?\n\n### Consumption\nHow does a maintainer (or agent) read the signals?\n- Dashboard? CLI query? Raw data?\n- What query patterns matter? (e.g., \"error rate for DEVICE_OFFLINE in v1.4.8 vs v1.4.7\")\n- Should there be alerting? (e.g., \"error rate spiked 3x after latest release\")\n\n### Privacy and trust\n- Document what's collected and what's not\n- Add to README or a TELEMETRY.md\n- Consider: npm ecosystem norms for CLI telemetry (Next.js, Turborepo, etc. as precedent)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Design doc in docs/plans/ covering payload, opt-in, transport, consumption\n- [ ] Privacy policy drafted\n- [ ] ReplicantError.toJSON() or similar produces the beacon payload\n- [ ] Telemetry is disabled by default, enabled via explicit opt-in\n- [ ] At least one consumption path works (even if it's just a JSONL file)\n- [ ] Tests cover: opt-in/out, payload shape, no PII leakage, transport failure handling","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"thecombatwombat@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-02-06T05:47:25.810368-08:00","created_by":"Archit Joshi","updated_at":"2026-02-06T05:47:25.810368-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"replicant-mcp-64u.1","depends_on_id":"replicant-mcp-64u","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-06T05:47:25.811018-08:00","created_by":"Archit Joshi"}]}

A broken dist/, missing file in package.json#files, or bad entry point would ship silently. The first signal would be a user report days later.\n\n## What to Design\n\n### Smoke test scope\nWhat's the minimum verification that catches real failures?\n- Install from npm registry: npm install replicant-mcp@\u003cjust-published-version\u003e\n- Start MCP server (stdio mode) and send ListTools request\n- Verify expected tool count (currently 12)\n- Verify server responds to a basic CallTool (e.g., cache get-stats, which needs no Android device)\n- Timeout: if server doesn't respond in 30s, fail\n\n### Existing code to reuse\n- tests/integration/mcp-protocol.test.ts already tests ListTools and tool count\n- The test spawns the server via @modelcontextprotocol/sdk Client\n- Challenge: this test runs against local dist/, not the published npm package\n- Design: extract the protocol test into a standalone script that can target either local or published package\n\n### CI integration\n- Where in release.yml? After the npm-publish step, before (or alongside) gh-release\n- Failure handling: if smoke test fails AFTER publish, the package is already on npm.

Start investigating\n\nThis can take days. With structured error codes already in the product (40+ ErrorCodes), pattern-matching on issue bodies is straightforward and should be automated.\n\n## What to Design\n\n### Issue parsing\n- Regex patterns to extract ErrorCode values from issue body (e.g., SDK_NOT_FOUND, BUILD_FAILED, DEVICE_OFFLINE)\n- Extract replicant-mcp version if mentioned\n- Extract OS/platform if mentioned\n- Handle: user pastes full JSON error output vs. just describes the error in prose\n\n### Auto-labeling\nMap ErrorCode prefixes to labels:\n- DEVICE_*, ADB_* → label: tool/adb\n- BUILD_*, GRADLE_* → label: tool/gradle\n- EMULATOR_* → label: tool/emulator\n- SDK_*, ENVIRONMENT_* → label: env/setup\n- UI_* → label: tool/ui\n- Create labels if they don't exist (first-run bootstrap)\n\n### Historical linking\n- Search closed issues for the same ErrorCode\n- If found, comment: \"This error was previously reported in #N and fixed in PR #M\"\n- If the telemetry beacon (issue #1) exists, also include: \"This error has been reported N times in the last 7 days\"\n\n### Issue template\n- Create .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml with structured fields:\n  - Error code (dropdown of common ones + \"other\")\n  - Tool name (dropdown)\n  - replicant-mcp version\n  - OS\n  - Steps to reproduce\n  - Full error output (textarea)\n- This makes parsing more reliable\n\n### Beads integration (stretch)\n- Auto-create a beads issue when a GitHub Issue is labeled as a confirmed bug\n- Or: comment with a suggested bd create command the maintainer can copy\n\n## Dependencies\n- Benefits significantly from telemetry beacon (issue #1) for frequency data\n- Works without it, but historical linking is limited to GitHub Issues only\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Design doc covering parsing strategy, label taxonomy, historical linking approach\n- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow triggers on issues.opened\n- [ ] Extracts ErrorCode from issue body (handles JSON and prose)\n- [ ] Applies tool-category labels\n- [ ] Comments with links to related closed issues if found\n- [ ] Bug report issue template created\n- [ ] Tested with sample issues containing various error formats","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"thecombatwombat@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-02-06T05:48:15.606055-08:00","created_by":"Archit Joshi","updated_at":"2026-02-06T05:48:15.606055-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"replicant-mcp-64u.3","depends_on_id":"replicant-mcp-64u","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-06T05:48:15.606592-08:00","created_by":"Archit Joshi"},{"issue_id":"replicant-mcp-64u.3","depends_on_id":"replicant-mcp-64u.1","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-06T05:48:36.497589-08:00","created_by":"Archit Joshi"}]}

If v1.4.8 changed the BUILD_FAILED context format or removed an error suggestion, this could break downstream parsing or confuse users — but it's invisible in auto-generated release notes.\n\n## What to Design\n\n### Diff strategy\n- Compare src/types/errors.ts between the previous tag and the new tag\n- Detect:\n  - New ErrorCodes added\n  - ErrorCodes removed\n  - ErrorCode enum value changes\n  - Changes to default suggestions (if extractable)\n- Output as a markdown section suitable for GitHub Release body\n\n### Implementation options\n1. **Shell script in release.sh**: Parse the diff with awk/grep, append to release notes\n   - Pro: No new dependencies, fits existing script pattern\n   - Con: Fragile parsing of TypeScript enums\n2. **TypeScript script**: Import/require the errors module from both versions, compare programmatically\n   - Pro: Reliable, type-safe\n   - Con: Need to build both versions, more complex\n3. **GitHub Actions step**: Run diff in CI during release workflow\n   - Pro: Runs after tag is pushed, has access to both versions via git\n   - Con: Release notes are created by softprops/action-gh-release — need to inject content\n\n### Release notes integration\n- Current flow: softprops/action-gh-release@v2 with generate_release_notes: true\n- Options to add error changelog:\n  - Prepend to auto-generated notes via the body parameter\n  - Use a separate step to update the release after creation (gh release edit)\n  - Template the release notes instead of auto-generating\n\n### Example output\n```markdown\n## Error Handling Changes\n- **Added**: `UI_SCREENSHOT_FAILED` - New error for screenshot capture failures\n- **Modified**: `BUILD_FAILED` - Updated suggestion text to include Gradle 8.x guidance\n- **Removed**: `DEVICE_NOT_SELECTED` - Merged into `DEVICE_OFFLINE`\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Design doc covering diff strategy and integration point\n- [ ] Script/action generates error-code diff between tags\n- [ ] Output included in GitHub Release notes\n- [ ] Handles: no changes (omit section), first release (list all codes)\n- [ ] Tested with mock tag diffs","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","owner":"thecombatwombat@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-02-06T05:48:15.751498-08:00","created_by":"Archit Joshi","updated_at":"2026-02-06T05:48:15.751498-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"replicant-mcp-64u.4","depends_on_id":"replicant-mcp-64u","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-06T05:48:15.752002-08:00","created_by":"Archit Joshi"}]}

This is correct for most changes, but it means the flywheel can't spin on low-risk fixes without a human online.\n\nOnce telemetry is flowing (issue #1) and issues are triaged automatically (issue #3), the bottleneck shifts from detection to shipping.
